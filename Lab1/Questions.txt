1. Write a simple MPI program to find out pow (x, rank) for all the processes where 'x' is the integer constant and 'rank' is the rank of the process.

2. Write a program in MPI where even ranked process prints "Hello" and odd ranked process prints "World".

3. Write a program in MPI to simulate simple calculator. Perform each operation using different process in parallel.

4. Write a program in MPI to toggle the character of a given string indexed by the rank of the process. 
Hint: Suppose the string is HELLO and there are 5 processes, then process 0 tog- gle 'H' to 'h', process 1 toggle 'E' to 'e' and so on.

5. Write a program in MPI where even ranked process prints factorial of the rank and odd ranked process prints ranks Fibonacci number.
